# Timber Starter Theme

## Installation

Optional: set up a local WP server. My preferred method is [this Docker image](https://gist.github.com/igloude/0fd62d4fc83c8d12c1bd289e27aea831)

- Install gulp CLI `npm install --global gulp-cli`
- Install and activate Timber plugin
- Install and activate ACF plugin and enter Pro license key
- Copy `.env.txt` file to a `.env` file
  - Update the `PORT` variable to match the port your localhost is serving to

## Development

- Start WP host server
- Run `gulp watch` in the command line from theme root
